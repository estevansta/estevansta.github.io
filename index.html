        <h2>BIO</h2>

            <p>John Clayton Mayer (born October 16, 1977 in Bridgeport, Connecticut) is an American singer-songwriter, guitarist, and record producer.</p>

            <p>In 2001 Mayer released his first full-length album Room for Squares, which spawned hits like "No Such Thing," "Your Body Is a Wonderland," and "Why Georgia." The album was critically praised and a multi-platinum commercial success, winning Mayer a Grammy for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance in 2003 for "Your Body Is a Wonderland." Mayer followed up with his sophomore album, Heavier Things, which also did considerably well, reaching the top of the Billboard 200. One of its releases, "Daughters," won the Grammy for Song of the Year.</p>

            <p>In 2005 Mayer began shifting his musical direction, focusing on the genre he first fell in love with: the blues. Teaming up with musicians Pino Palladino and Steve Jordan, Mayer formed the blues and rock band the John Mayer Trio. The group released the live album Try!, which received a Grammy nomination for Best Rock Album. </p>

            <p>In 2006 Mayer released his third studio album, Continuum, which received a Grammy for Best Pop Album and another Grammy for its single "Waiting on the World to Change." With yet another huge success under his belt, Mayer felt skittish with starting a follow-up album, but he forged ahead with the release of Battle Studies in 2009. Despite mixed critics' views, the album did well and its arena tour garnered an impressive $45 million.</p>
